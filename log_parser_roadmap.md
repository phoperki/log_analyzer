# Log Parser Mini-Project - Complete Roadmap

## Project Overview
Build a command-line log analyzer that reads security/system log files and extracts meaningful information. This project teaches you file parsing, pattern matching, data analysis, and eventually regex - all in a cybersecurity context.

---

## Version Breakdown

### v0.1 - Basic Log Analysis (Day 1 - 45-60 min)
**Core Goal:** Read logs and count different message types

**Features:**
1. Read a log file line by line
2. Count ERROR, WARNING, and INFO messages
3. Display a summary of counts
4. Show all ERROR lines for review

**Functions Needed:**
- `read_log_file(filename)` - Read and return lines from file
- `count_log_levels(log_lines)` - Count each log level type
- `get_errors(log_lines)` - Filter and return all ERROR lines
- `display_summary(counts)` - Print formatted summary
- `main()` - Orchestrate the analysis

**Skills Practiced:**
- File reading (you already know this!)
- String searching with `in` operator
- Dictionary counting patterns
- List filtering
- Building complete analysis tools

**Success Criteria:**
- Reads log file without errors
- Accurately counts each log level
- Displays all ERROR messages
- Output is clear and readable

**Sample Log File to Use:**
Create `system.log` with this content:
```
2025-01-15 08:23:45 INFO Server started successfully
2025-01-15 08:23:46 INFO Loading configuration file
2025-01-15 08:24:12 WARNING Connection timeout on port 8080
2025-01-15 08:24:15 ERROR Failed to connect to database
2025-01-15 08:24:20 INFO Retrying database connection
2025-01-15 08:24:25 ERROR Database authentication failed
2025-01-15 08:25:01 WARNING Low memory: 85% usage
2025-01-15 08:25:30 INFO User admin logged in
2025-01-15 08:26:15 ERROR File not found: config.json
2025-01-15 08:27:00 INFO Backup completed successfully
2025-01-15 08:28:45 WARNING Disk space low: 90% full
2025-01-15 08:29:00 ERROR Permission denied: /var/log/secure
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== LOG ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===
Total ERROR messages: 4
Total WARNING messages: 3
Total INFO messages: 5

=== ERROR DETAILS ===
2025-01-15 08:24:15 ERROR Failed to connect to database
2025-01-15 08:24:25 ERROR Database authentication failed
2025-01-15 08:26:15 ERROR File not found: config.json
2025-01-15 08:29:00 ERROR Permission denied: /var/log/secure
```

**Bonus Challenges (if finished early):**
1. Show WARNING details too (not just errors)
2. Count total lines processed
3. Find most common error type (database vs file vs permission)
4. Add a menu system for different views

---

### v0.2 - Pattern Extraction with Regex (Day 2 - 45-60 min)
**Core Goal:** Extract specific information from log lines using regex

**New Features:**
1. Extract all IP addresses from logs
2. Parse and collect timestamps
3. Find failed login attempts with usernames
4. Count occurrences of each IP address

**Functions to Add:**
- `extract_ip_addresses(log_lines)` - Find all IPs using regex
- `extract_timestamps(log_lines)` - Pull out all timestamps
- `find_failed_logins(log_lines)` - Detect login failures
- `count_by_ip(log_lines)` - Count events per IP address

**Skills Practiced:**
- Introduction to regex module (`import re`)
- Basic regex patterns (`\d+`, `\w+`, etc.)
- `re.search()` and `re.findall()`
- Pattern matching vs exact matching

**New Sample Log File:**
Add to `system.log` or create `access.log`:
```
2025-01-15 10:15:23 INFO Login successful from 192.168.1.100 user: alice
2025-01-15 10:16:45 ERROR Failed login attempt from 203.0.113.45 user: admin
2025-01-15 10:17:12 WARNING Multiple failed attempts from 203.0.113.45
2025-01-15 10:18:30 INFO Login successful from 10.0.0.25 user: bob
2025-01-15 10:19:05 ERROR Failed login attempt from 203.0.113.45 user: root
2025-01-15 10:20:15 ERROR Failed login attempt from 198.51.100.78 user: admin
2025-01-15 10:21:00 INFO Logout from 192.168.1.100 user: alice
```

**Regex Patterns You'll Learn:**
- IP addresses: `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`
- Timestamps: `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}`
- Usernames: `user: (\w+)`

**Success Criteria:**
- Extracts all IP addresses correctly
- Identifies failed login attempts
- Counts which IPs appear most frequently
- Can parse timestamps from log format

---

### v0.3 - Security Analysis (Day 3 - 45-60 min)
**Core Goal:** Detect security threats and anomalies

**New Features:**
1. Detect brute force attacks (multiple failed logins from same IP)
2. Identify suspicious patterns (failed root access, permission errors)
3. Generate security alerts for high-risk events
4. Create a threat summary report

**Functions to Add:**
- `detect_brute_force(log_lines, threshold=3)` - Find IPs with multiple failed logins
- `find_suspicious_activity(log_lines)` - Look for dangerous patterns
- `generate_security_report(log_lines)` - Comprehensive security summary
- `alert_priority(event_type)` - Assign severity levels

**Skills Practiced:**
- Security pattern recognition
- Threshold-based detection
- Data aggregation and analysis
- Report generation

**Security Patterns to Detect:**
- Multiple failed logins from same IP (brute force)
- Failed root/admin access attempts
- Permission denied errors (possible privilege escalation)
- Unusual login times (outside business hours)
- Successful login after multiple failures

**Success Criteria:**
- Identifies IPs with 3+ failed login attempts
- Flags all root/admin access attempts
- Generates prioritized alert list
- Creates actionable security report

### v0.4 - Advanced Parsing & Export (Day 4 - 45-60 min)
**Core Goal:** Handle different log formats and export results

**New Features:**
1. Parse different log formats (Apache, Nginx, syslog, custom)
2. Export analysis results to CSV
3. Generate HTML report with color coding
4. Handle multi-line log entries

**Functions to Add:**
- `detect_log_format(filename)` - Auto-detect log type
- `parse_apache_log(line)` - Parse Apache access logs
- `export_to_csv(results, filename)` - Save analysis as CSV
- `generate_html_report(results)` - Create visual report

**Skills Practiced:**
- Format detection and adaptation
- CSV writing (you know this!)
- HTML generation basics
- Multi-line parsing with regex

**Different Log Formats:**

**Apache Access Log:**
```
192.168.1.100 - - [15/Jan/2025:10:15:23 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 403 512
203.0.113.45 - admin [15/Jan/2025:10:16:45 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 128
```

**Syslog Format:**
```
Jan 15 10:15:23 server01 sshd[1234]: Failed password for admin from 203.0.113.45 port 22 ssh2
Jan 15 10:16:45 server01 sshd[1235]: Accepted password for alice from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2

1. **Read requirements** - Understand what you're building
2. **Plan functions** - Sketch out what each function needs to do
3. **Build minimum version** - Get it working with basic functionality
4. **Test with sample data** - Use the provided log files
5. **Debug and refine** - Fix issues, improve output
6. **Add polish** - Error handling, better formatting
7. **Celebrate!** - Working code is always a win

### Learning Progression:
- **v0.1:** Pure Python skills (no new concepts)
- **v0.2:** Introduction to regex (learn as you need it)
- **v0.3:** Security analysis thinking
- **v0.4:** Format handling and exports
- **v0.5+:** Advanced topics (optional)

### Time Estimates:

## Regex Learning Strategy

**Key Principle:** Don't learn regex in isolation. Learn it when you hit a problem that needs it.

### v0.1: NO REGEX
- Use string methods you already know
- Build a working log parser
- Gain confidence with file processing

### v0.2: INTRODUCE REGEX
- Hit a real problem: "I need to extract IP addresses"
- Learn the specific pattern you need RIGHT NOW
- Apply it immediately to YOUR code
- See it work in YOUR project

### v0.3+: USE REGEX NATURALLY
- You'll recognize when regex is the right tool
- You'll know the basics and can look up specific patterns
- You'll have real context for understanding patterns

**This prevents tutorial hell and builds real understanding.**

---

## Getting Started

**When you're ready for v0.1:**
1. Create `log_parser.py`
2. Create `system.log` with the sample data
3. Build the four functions
4. Get it working
5. Show me your code!

**You can also:**
- Ask questions about any version before starting
- Skip versions if you want
- Combine versions if you're feeling ambitious
- Stop at any version (each is a complete tool!)
- Take breaks between versions

---

## Quick Reference: String Methods vs Regex

### Use String Methods When:
- Checking if text contains a word: `"ERROR" in line`
- Splitting by delimiter: `line.split()`
- Simple replacements: `line.replace("old", "new")`
- Case-insensitive checks: `line.lower()`

### Use Regex When:
- Extracting patterns (IP addresses, emails, phone numbers)
- Validating formats (dates, times, identifiers)
- Complex replacements with patterns
- Capturing specific groups from text

**v0.1 uses only string methods. v0.2+ introduces regex when needed.**

## Notes

- Start with v0.1 TODAY - no regex, just skills you have
- v0.2 is where you'll learn regex (I'll teach you then)
- Each version builds on the previous one
- You can stop at any version and have a working tool
- Take breaks between versions - this is multi-day work
- Ask for hints liberally - struggling is good, spinning wheels isn't

**Ready to build v0.1? Just say "Starting v0.1 now!" and get coding!** 🔥

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Once you've completed v0.1-v0.4, you could:
- Add command-line arguments (specify log file from terminal)
- Create a web interface (Flask/Django)
- Build a dashboard (visualize trends over time)
- Integrate with SIEM systems
- Add automatic remediation suggestions
- Create custom alert rules engine

**This project can grow with your skills for as long as you want!**
